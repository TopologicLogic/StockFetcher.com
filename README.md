# StockFetcher.com
These are a few quantitative trading strategies based on stockfetcher.com scripting language.  Most look to exploit high volatility (specific high/low swings) and scalp them for a few percent.

Though no longer available at stockfetcher.com, they performed pretty well in backtesting despite relatively simple criteria.  The numbers that define the indicator time periods were discovered via trial/error optimization searches but represent very intuitive (human) intervals in the five day trading week.  2 (different between two days), 5 (one week), 20 (one month), 40 (two months), etc.

Note: In back-testing for each group of stocks returned, they were sorted by volume descending and the top two were selected to trade.
